    	 				Apex Legends is an online multiplayer battle royale game featuring squads of three players using pre-made characters (called "Legends"), similar to those of hero shooters.Each match generally features twenty teams of three-player squads. Players can join friends in a squad or can be matched randomly with other players. Prior to the match, each player on the squad selects one of the 12 playable characters (as of Season 4), with the exception that no character may be selected more than once by a squad.

    	 			<p>Once on the ground, the squad can scavenge for weapons, armor, and other equipment that is scattered around buildings, or in crates randomly distributed around the map, while keeping an eye out for other squads. Apex Legends includes a nonverbal communication "ping system" which allows players to use their game controller to communicate to their squad certain directions, weapon locations, enemies and suggested strategies.
    	 			Over time, the game's safe zone will reduce in size around a randomly-selected point on the map; players outside the safe zone take damage and may die if they do not reach the safe zone in time.

    	 				 This also confines squads to smaller spaces to force encounters. The last squad with any members left alive are crowned the "Apex Champions" of that match. Players are awarded in-game currency based on their squad's placement as well as experience points.
    	 			</p>

						Apex Legends is a free-to-play game, monetized through microtransactions and loot boxes, which allow the player to spend both real money and in-game currency on cosmetic items, such as outfits for the Legends and new colors for weapons.
