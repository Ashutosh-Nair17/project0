    				<h3> Gameplay </h3>
    				<p style="font-c">
    					Warzone features two primary game modes: Battle Royale and Plunder.[5] It is the second main battle royale installment in the Call of Duty franchise, following the "Blackout" mode of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018). Warzone differs from Black Ops 4 by reducing reliance on equipable gadgets and instead encouraging the accumulation of a new in-game currency called Cash.[5] Warzone supports up to 150 players in a single match, which exceeds the typical size of 100 players seen in other battle royale titles.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    					Character death in Battle Royale does not necessarily translate to player defeat like in other titles. Instead, the mode offers a respawn mechanic which players can take advantage of in various ways. Players who are killed are transported to the "Gulag", where they engage in one-on-one combat with another defeated player, with both players being given same weaponry. 
    				</p>
    				<p>
    					In the Plunder mode,[8] teams have to search for stacks of Cash scattered around the map to accumulate $1 million. Once found, the game goes into overtime, with all Cash sums by 1.5, and the team who has gathered the most money when the clock runs out is declared the winner. Players respawn automatically in this gamemode. Blood Money is a variation of Plunder where additional cash bonuses are granted upon contract completions and successful executions of finishing moves.

    					Every player starts off with the X16 pistol with no attachments. Players can pick up every component found in a standard loadout as they search the map for items located on the ground as well as in supply boxes found in designated locations. Additional equipment unique to the Warzone game mode is shield plates. Three of these shield plates can be applied to a player at a given time with the ability to carry 5 shields in the players inventory. Players can also pick up cash that can be used at buy stations for various purposes.
